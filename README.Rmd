# Multi-Time Points Analysis
In the data analysis of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), linear model frameworks, especially the mass univariate analysis (MUA), are often performed when researchers consider examining the difference between conditions at each sampled time point. 

However, some statistical issues, such as assumptions of linearity, auto-correlation and multiple comparison problems, influence the statistical inferences when using the MUA on fNIRS time course data. 

Therefore, we proposed a novel perspective, **Multi-Time Points Analysis (MTPA)**, to discriminate signal differences between conditions by combining temporal information from multiple time points in fNIRS.

The MTPA adopted the random forest algorithm from statistical learning domain, followed by a series of cross validation procedures, providing reasonable power for detecting significant time points and ensuring the generalizability. 

Using an real fNIRS dataset, the proposed MTPA would outperform the MUA. As we seen in the following figure, the MUA with either false discovery rate correction or bonferroni correction could not detect any significant time points. Even we applied two non-parametric permutation frameworks, including the maximum *t*-statistics and the 1-D temporal clustering methods, the MUA still could not show any finding. In contrast, the proposed MTPA can successfully detect more time points showing significant differences between experimental conditions.

Furthermore, the MTPA could also easily make a comparison between different areas, leading to a novel viewpoint of fNIRS time course analysis and providing additional theoretical implications in future fNIRS studies.

The present repository contains (1) an real fNIRS dataset as an example, (2) the code that demonstrated how to use MTPA in the basic `R` environment, (3) the code of doing the MUA for comparison, and (4) the code to generate figures.

Have fun with **MTPA** !
